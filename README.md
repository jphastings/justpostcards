> The handwritten word, delivered by hand

I want to bring some magic back to mail so I've decided to start a postal service of my own, it's a little unusualâ€¦

If you see me I'll deliver a postcard for you, by hand, anywhere on Earth. The nearer the destination is to places I normally am the faster it'll arrive; the further away, the longer it'll take and the more exciting my adventure to get there will be.

To make sure I'm not overwhelmed or left without postcards to deliver I'll ask you for a very small sum of money per delivery (10p for each postcard I've been asked to deliver in the last 7 days) which I'll donate to a literacy charity.

Happy writing,

JP
